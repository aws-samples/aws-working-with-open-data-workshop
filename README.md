When data is shared on AWS, anyone can analyze it and build services on top of it using a broad range of compute and data analytics AWS services, including [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/), [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/), [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/) and others. Sharing data in the cloud lets data users spend more time on data analysis rather than data acquisition.
